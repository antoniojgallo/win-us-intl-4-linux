win-us-intl-4-linux
===================

Keyboard layout for Linux that tries to emulate the US-International keyboard layout for Windows (and Mac OS)

This is not my own work. I took it from http://tamh.info/en/win-us-intl-4-linux/

I made a repository because I couldn't see any repository in github I could fork

I have not tested it thoroughly, So I cannot give my personal guarantee that it works as intended

For instructions and more detailed information, take a look at the file win-us-intl-4-linux.pdf
It is a printout of the blog entry of the original author
